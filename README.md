# HamzaHub
## Complete and automaticed management system for dangerous goods on a indexed warehouse written in Python and SQL.

HamzaHub is a working managment system inspired by years of having to deal with dangerous goods in the logistics field. My main objective was make it fully functional, easy to use and easly customizable so anybody could start to use it on their workspace. The main features that HamzaHub has are:
- Database creation over customizable user characteristics representing real Warehouse. 
- Customizable Tkinter GUI.
- Fully managable Inbound and Outbound characteristics. 
- Bulk Locations and automatized moves for releash of orders. 
- Login.
- Input orders and inbound information via .csv

It is, also, my final project for *CS50 Introduction with Python*.
